## Address Python Coding 

The code reads a text file containing a list of names and addresses, and then organizes the information into a dictionary.

First, we define a function called "parse_file" that takes in a file path as an argument.

The function opens the file using the open() function, reads its contents into a variable called "file_contents", and then splits the contents of the file by newline characters to create a list of strings, where each string represents a line from the file.

We then create an empty dictionary called "address_book".

The function then iterates through the list of strings and splits each line by commas to create a list of lists, where each sublist represents the name and address of a person.

We then iterate through the list of lists and use the first element of each sublist as the key, and the second element as the value, and add them to the "address_book" dictionary.

Finally, we return the "address_book" dictionary.

In the main part of the code, we call the parse_file() function with the file path of the sample file and print the returned dictionary to the console.
